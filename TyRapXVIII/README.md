# TyRapXVIII

This is the 2018 robot code for the FIRST Power Up competition.

The robot is Command robot, which means its code is structured as commands and subsystems.

Subsystems - define the capabilities of each part of the robot and are subclasses of Subsystem.

Commands - define the operation of the robot incorporating the capabilities defined in the subsystems. Commands are subclasses of Command or CommandGroup. Commands run when scheduled or in response to buttons being pressed or virtual buttons from the SmartDashboard.
